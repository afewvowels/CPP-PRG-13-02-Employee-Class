//  Write a class named Employee that has the following member variables:
//
//      * name - a string that holds the employee's name
//      * idNumber - an int variable that holds the employee's ID number
//      * department - a string that holds the name of the department where the employee
//        works
//      * position - a string that holds the employee's job title
//
//  The class should have the following constructors:
//
//      * A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to
//        the appropriate member variables: employee's name, employee's ID number,
//        department, and position.
//      * A constructor that accepts the following values as arguments and assigns them to
//        the appropriate member variables: employee's name and ID number. The department
//        and position fields should be assigned an empty string ("").
//      * A default constructor that assigns empty strings ("") to the name, department, and
//        position member variables, and 0 to the idNumber member variable.
//
//  Write appropriate mutator functions that store values in these member variables and
//  accessor functions that return the values in these member variables. Once you have
//  written the class, write a separate program that creates three Employee objects to hold
//  the following data:
//
//  Name                ID Number           Department              Position
//  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Susan Meyers        47899               Accounting              Vice President
//  Mark Jones          39119               IT                      Programmer
//  Joy Rogers          81774               Manufacturing           Engineer
//
//  The program should store this data in three objects and then display the data for
//  each employee on the screen.
